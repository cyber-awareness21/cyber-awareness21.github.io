Why Cyber Scammers Are Earning More Than Engineers — The Real Debate | Codevirus Security Pvt. Ltd.

In the digital age, the world is rapidly shifting toward online-first interactions — whether it’s banking, communication, shopping, or work. This transformation has immense benefits, but unfortunately, it has also given rise to a parallel economy driven by cybercrime. Shockingly, some cyber scammers today are earning more than professional engineers. This isn’t just a controversial statement — it’s a growing reality.

1. The Lucrative Nature of Cyber Scams

One of the most startling truths about cybercrime is the low barrier to entry and high financial payoff:

A scammer can launch phishing campaigns, spoof websites, and execute malware attacks with minimal upfront costs.

Earnings from a single successful scam can surpass monthly salaries of skilled engineers.

Many attacks are automated and scalable, allowing perpetrators in one region to defraud victims globally.

This has created an underground economy where cybercriminals acquire tools, exploit kits, and “crime-as-a-service” platforms. Compared to the traditional engineering path — with degrees, certifications, and years of experience — cyber scams can profit quickly and with less accountability.

2. Skill vs. Motivation

There’s a common misconception that only unskilled individuals become cybercriminals. The truth is more complex:

Many scammers are technically savvy and understand networking, social engineering, and software vulnerabilities.

However, rather than pursuing legitimate careers, they choose shortcuts driven by greed, anonymity, and perceived lower risk of consequences.

In many regions, especially where economic opportunities are limited, cybercrime becomes an attractive — albeit illegal — way to earn.

3. Lack of Regulation and Prosecution

Cybercrime often crosses international borders, making law enforcement challenging. In many cases:

Jurisdictional issues delay prosecution.

Victims may not report crimes due to embarrassment or uncertainty.

Limited cybersecurity infrastructure in many countries allows attackers to operate with impunity.

This contributes to a toxic feedback loop: scammers see minimal risk and massive reward.

4. Engineers Are Still in High Demand — But Earnings Don’t Reflect It (Yet)

Despite the alarming trends, engineers remain critical to every sector:

Software, AI, cloud computing, fintech, and healthcare all rely on engineering talent.

Salaries have grown steadily, but they rarely match the quick gains seen in criminal activity.

However, engineers build solutions; scammers exploit vulnerabilities. Closing this gap means increasing cybersecurity awareness and strengthening ethical incentives in tech education and employment.

Conclusion

The debate around why cyber scammers are earning more than engineers isn’t just about dollars — it’s about systems, incentives, and digital ethics. As long as cybercrime remains lucrative and law enforcement remains stretched, the imbalance will persist.
